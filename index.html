                    <h2>About</h2>
                    
                    <p>Hey, my name's Joe Liang. I have more than a decade of programming experience and transitioned into a freelance front-end web designer/developer. I'm passionate about a variety of web technologies with particular fondness for JavaScript and React. Some of my favorite apps I've made using these technologies include a <a href="http://1000mileworld.com/Portfolio/Piano/keyboard.html" target="_blank">piano keyboard</a> and <a href="https://1000mileworld.github.io/Pomodoro-Clock/" target="_blank">pomodoro clock</a>.</p>
                    
                    <p>In between projects, you can always find me learning and experimenting with new ideas. Currently I'm having fun with some animation libraries such as Animate.css and Anime.js. I also aspire to become a full stack developer, with plans to learn Node.js and SQL in the works. I share my joy of learning web development with others through running a blog on <a href="https://www.1000mileworld.com" target="_blank">1000 Mile World</a> and writing beginner-friendly articles on <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/author/joeliang/" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp.org</a>.</p>

                    <p>In my spare time, I'm an avid ultimate frisbee player. I enjoy good food, good beer, and good company.</p>
